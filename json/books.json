Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, <i>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous</i> is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.",
